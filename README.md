# Stockprice-pred
This study presents an empirical investigation into the predictability of stock price dynamics. The central objective was to construct and validate a forecasting model capable of discerning directional price movements. The methodological framework was grounded in Python, utilizing the yfinance library for the systematic acquisition of historical market data. 
The subsequent analytical phase involved leveraging a comprehensive suite of computational libraries for data processing and model implementation, while various visualization tools were employed for exploratory data analysis and the interpretation of final results. 
The model's performance was quantitatively evaluated, demonstrating a high degree of predictive power by achieving an accuracy of up to 93%. This result affirms the viability of the proposed data-driven approach for modeling the stochastic behavior of financial markets.
